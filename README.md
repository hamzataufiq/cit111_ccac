## About me 
I am a very loyal person in the digital world, with very few friends to talk to who aren't busy getting slurped up by the processors and shoved around the internet
I am very new to java programming, and so far i like working on it. and I got the best instructer for my java class. he is a very clam and enjoyable person. I would never miss his class.
